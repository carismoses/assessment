# Research Problem

Robotic manipulation tasks such as cooking a meal or cleaning a room require robots to grasp, move, and place objects. These tasks involve object interactions and physical understanding. For example, the notion of object stability is important if a robot is tidying a room and stacking objects on top of eachother. It must arrange the objects so that they don't fall. Robot understanding of other physical concepts such as friction and modes of interaction are important, but for this assignment we will focus on stability. The objective of this assignment is to familiarize you with a simple notion of object stability and to visualize solutions to finding stable arrangements of objects in a simulator.

If any part of this problem interests you, try out the assignment below. Please dedicate at least 8 hours to it, and turn in what you have completed in that time. I encourage you to reach out to me at carism@mit.edu if you have any questions! 

## Course Prerequisites

Students applying and completing this assignment should have completed course 6.006 and 6.009. If you feel that you are a good fit but have not completed these courses please email me and we can discuss.

## Directions

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 (probably will work with earlier versions, but try to use this version)
- pip3
- git

### Install Instructins

I ran everything on a Mac, but I can try to help debug platform issues.

1. Fork this repository into your GitHub account and clone it
2. Run ```pip3 install .``` to get dependencies
3. Run ```pip3 install git+https://github.com/hauptmech/odio_urdf``` (another dependency)
4. Run ```jupyter notebook assignment.pynb``` to launch a notebook in a browser
5. Fill in the required coding portions and questions 
6. When you are finished, commit and push your answers to your fork. Send me an email linking to your repo. You can either add me as a collaboarator or make the repo public.
